## Project #2

Give a high-level overview of the project purpose

- Describe the application and why you created this program

  - The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that serves as a backend server for users. The project aims to provide secure platform for users to perform CRUD operations on wizards and spells, implement RESTful API endpoints, and incorporate authentication and authorization processes using hashing and JWT (JSON Web Token).

- Describe the overall structure of your application and the design process prior to building the program

      - The task was to design and develop a backend server for a users that allows users to perform CRUD operations on wizards and spells. The application should follow RESTful principles, implement authentication and authorization processes, and utilize hashing and JWT for secure user authentication. The overall structure of the application needed to be well-designed and organized to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

- Explain the code you wrote to achieve your desired result

       . I implemented RESTful API endpoints using Express.js for CRUD operations on wizards and spells. I handled authentication and authorization using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for secure token-based authentication. Additionally, I utilized middleware functions to ensure user authentication and authorization for protected routes.

- Showcase your final application with its functionality

       . The final application is a backend server that allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on wizards and spells.

       . Users can securely authenticate using hashed passwords and receive JWT tokens for subsequent requests.

       . The API follows RESTful principles, providing intuitive endpoints for managing resources.

       . The application ensures proper authentication and authorization for protected routes, enhancing security and user access control.

## Competencies

JOB FUNCTION 3: Apply the process of server-side development, including explaining algorithms, logic and data structures, can develop and maintain databases and codebases, and explain and implement APIs.

### JF 3.6 Can implement a RESTful API

- Describe a situation where you demonstrated this job function.

  . I was responsible to design and implement the RESTful API architecture and endpoints to support creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts and comments. The API needed to follow RESTful principles and provide a seamless interface for user to interact with the server.

- Summarize the actions you took to accomplish the goal.

  . To accomplish the goal of implementing a RESTful API and applying server-side development processes, I designed the data structure, developed the application using Express.js, implemented CRUD operations, maintained databases, implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms, documented the codebase, and followed RESTful principles for API implementation.

- Emphasize the results of this action for your team or your learning.

. The results of these actions allowed me to gain valuable experience and knowledge in server-side development, algorithms, logic, data structures, database management, and API implementation. This hands-on experience greatly enhanced my understanding and proficiency in server-side development, equipping me with valuable skills for future projects.

### JF 3.8 Can encrypt sensitive data via hashing

- Describe a situation where you demonstrated this job function.

  . I was assigned to create a secure user authentication system for a project.

- Summarize the actions you took to accomplish the goal.

  . To accomplish this, I used bcrypt, hashing algorithm, to encrypt and store user passwords in a secure manner. I explained the concept of password hashing to the team and implemented it into the authentication system.

- Emphasize the results of this action for your team or your learning.

  - As a result, the application had a robust security system in place, ensuring that user passwords and sensitive data were well-protected. This experience allowed me to gain a better understanding of data encryption techniques and reinforced my skills in server-side development.
