## Project #1

Give a high-level overview of the project purpose
- (*Situation*) Describe the application and why you created this program

 ✨The Movies application is designed to provide users with a platform to explore and discover movies. The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to                search for movies, view their details, and switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

- (*Task*) Describe the overall structure of your application and the design process prior to building the program


✨ The overall structure of the application follows a React-based architecture. Before building the program, the design process involved planning the user interface, including the home page, Movie               Details page, and Navigation menu. The goal was to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface that allows users to easily search for movies and navigate through the application.

- (*Action*) Explain the code you wrote to achieve your desired result


✨ The code written for the application utilizes React components, including functional components and hooks such as useState and useEffect. Axios is used for making HTTP requests to fetch movie data           from the TMDB API. React Router is employed for handling routing and rendering different components based on the URL path. The design is implemented using the React Bootstrap library, providing            responsive and pre-styled components.

- (*Result*) Showcase your final application with its functionality


✨ The final application consists of a Home page that displays a movie list and a search bar for filtering movies. Clicking on a movie card opens the Movie Details page, showcasing additional                   information about the selected movie. Users can toggle between light and dark themes using the theme switch. The Navigation menu allows easy navigation between sections of the app. The application           provides an engaging and user-friendly experience for movie exploration.

✨✨ JOB FUNCTION 2: Take a business or user problem, 
    gather data to analyze the problem, and use prototyping tools to 
    create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the 
    application,and use agile project management.

- Describe a situation where you demonstrated this job function.

✨ I was responsible with improving the user experience of a Movie App. The current version lacks a user-friendly interface and requires enhancements to better engage users. My role involves taking the user    problem into account, gathering data to analyze the issues, and utilizing prototyping tools to create high-fidelity wireframes and a UI framework. You will test the application to validate the              improvements and follow an agile project management approach for efficient development.

- Summarize the actions you took to accomplish the goal. 

✨ Gathering Data and Analyzing the Problem:
✨ Prototyping and Creating High-Fidelity Wireframes
✨ Designing UI Framework

✨ Emphasize the results of this action for your team or your learning.
        Enhanced User Experience: By addressing user problems and incorporating feedback, the redesigned interface provides an improved user experience. Users can navigate the app more intuitively, access           relevant movie information, and engage with the content more effectively.

✨ Improved Engagement: The high-fidelity wireframes and UI framework contribute to a visually appealing and engaging design. Users are more likely to spend time exploring the app, discovering movies of        interest, and interacting with the provided features, leading to increased user engagement.
